Common examples of sampling bias:

1. ==Selection bias==
	- If each member of the population does not have an equal chance of ending up in the sample, e.g. those who are willing to answer a survey in a public place are different from those who prefer not to be bothered.
	- ==Self-selection bias==: whenever individuals volunteer to be tested.
	
2. ==Population bias==
	- Positive findings are more likely to be published than negative findings. Unusual things happen once in a while (chance). If you conduct 100 studies, one is likely to turn up results that are nonsense. However, this one study that does find a link is published.

3. ==Recall bias==
	- Data that contains information that people had to recall (cross-sectional) are inherently less reliable than when this information was collected at that point in time (longitudinal).

4. ==Survivorship bias==
	- When some or many of the observations fall out of the sample, changing the composition of the observations.

5. ==Healthy user bias==
	- People who faithfully engage in activities that are good for them - taking a drug as prescribed, or eating what they believe is a healthy diet - are fundamentally different from those who don't.
