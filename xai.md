**Explainable AI (XAI)** is a field that seeks to make the decision-making processes of AI systems more understandable and transparent to humans. The goal is to create models that can provide clear explanations for their predictions or actions, allowing users to trust and interpret the outputs of the models.

## Tools and Libraries

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):** A popular [[Python]] library for interpreting machine learning models. It helps you understand the impact of each feature on model predictions.
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):** Another [[Python]] library that provides local model-agnostic interpretability.
- [**InterpretML**](https://interpret.ml/): An open-source library from Microsoft that simplifies the model interpretability process.
