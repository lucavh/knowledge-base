Some reasons for scaling features:

- Models that rely on the distance between a pair of samples, for instance k-nearest neighbors, should be trained on normalized features to make each feature contribute approximately equally to the distance computations.
- Many models such as logistic [[regression]] use a numerical solver (based on gradient descent) to find their optimal parameters. This solver converges faster when the features are scaled.

Whether or not a machine learning model requires scaling the features depends on the model family. Linear models such as logistic [[regression]] generally benefit from scaling the features while other models such as decision trees do not need such preprocessing (but will not suffer from it).
