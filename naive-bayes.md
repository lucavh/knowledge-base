Naive Bayes is a [[supervised-learning]] algorithm that can be trained to classify data into multi-class categories. In the heart of the Naive Bayes algorithm is the probabilistic model that computes the **conditional probabilities** of the input features and assigns the [[probability]] distributions to each of the possible classes.
