The Covid-19 crisis has an extraordinary effect on global economic activity. After this crisis it will remain important to take this period into account when training machine learning models on historic data. An important step is to identify when your industry started to get affected by the crisis and — once the crisis is over — when it returns to a new normal. This problem is called **time series change point detection**. 

Approaches to detect abrupt change points include [[piecewise-linear-regression]] (PLR), and [[hidden-markov-models]] (HMM).
