The controller design principle advocates separating user interface and business logic by using a controller component. This enhances maintainability and testability. 

For example, in a web application, the controller handles user inputs and communicates with models, resulting in a modular and easier-to-maintain system.

The controller design principle belongs to the set of [[grasp-design-patterns]].
