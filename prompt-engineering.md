- Assign a role, set boundaries, specify response formats, and highlight areas of focus: “Imagine you’re a market analyst (_assigning a role_) with expertise in the European tech sector (_setting boundaries_). Could you provide a SWOT analysis (_specifying the format_) for a U.S-based tech company looking to launch a new AI product in Europe (_further limiting the scope)?_ Focus on potential market opportunities, major threats, and key regulatory considerations in your analysis (_area of focus_).”
- Ask to collaborate, rather than telling what to do. This will encourage it to ask for clarification if it isn’t entirely sure what you want, rather than just guessing and giving you what it thinks you want: “Let’s work together to develop a marketing plan for launching a new product in the next quarter. We need to consider target audience, channels of promotion, and potential challenges. What are your thoughts?”
