There are two cultures of structuring a machine learning team, depending on the organization.

One culture says that a machine learning team has to be composed of data analysts who
collaborate closely with software engineers. In such a culture, a software engineer doesnâ€™t need to have profound expertise in machine learning but has to understand the vocabulary of their fellow data analysts or scientists. 

According to the other culture, all engineers in a machine learning team must have a combination of machine learning and software engineering skills.

Besides having __machine learning and software engineering skills__, a machine learning team may include experts in __data labeling__ and __data engineering experts__. __DevOps engineers__ work closely with __machine learning engineers__ to automate model deployment, loading, monitoring, and occasional or regular model maintenance. Some companies introduced the MLOps role, whose responsibility
is to deploy machine learning models in production, upgrade those models, and build data processing pipelines involving machine learning models.
