**Gradient** is the generalization of **derivative** for functions that take several inputs (or one input in the form of a vector). A gradient of a function is a vector of **partial derivatives**. Partial derivatives are determined by focusing on one of the function's inputs and by considering all other inputs as constant values (notation: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$).
