People pleasing is a behavior pattern where individuals prioritize others’ needs, approval, and expectations over their own well-being. It often stems from a fear of rejection, low self-esteem, or a desire to avoid conflict.  
## Key Methods to Overcome People Pleasing  

- **Set Boundaries** – Learn to say no without guilt and protect personal time and energy.  
- **Prioritize Self-Worth** – Recognize that your value is not based on others’ approval.  
- **Manage Guilt** – Understand that saying no or disagreeing is not selfish.  
- **Practice Assertiveness** – Express opinions and needs with confidence.  
- **Identify Triggers** – Recognize situations that lead to people-pleasing behavior.  

Breaking the cycle of people pleasing allows for healthier relationships and greater personal fulfillment.
