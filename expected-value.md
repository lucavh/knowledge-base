[[Probability]] allows you to calculate the ==expected value==. That is the sum of all different outcomes, each weighted by its [[probability]] and pay-off.

Exemple:
- A game in which you roll a single dice
- Pay off: 1 - $1, 2 - $2, 3 - $3, etc.
- [[Probability]]: `1/6` for each possible outcome
- Expected value: `1/6 * $1 + 1/6 * $2 + ... + 1/6 * $6 = $3.50`
- Suppose you have to pay $3 to play the game, then the expected value is higher than the cost of playing. Thus, it's worth taking the risk.
