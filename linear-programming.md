Linear programming (LP) is a mathematical optimization technique used to find the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships. It involves maximizing or minimizing a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. 

One of the popular Python libraries for solving linear programming problems is [[pulp]]. 

**Key Concepts:**

- **Objective Function:** A linear function representing the quantity to be maximized or minimized.
- **Decision Variables:** Variables that determine the solution.
- **Constraints:** Linear equations or inequalities that restrict the possible values for decision variables.
- **Feasible Region:** The set of solutions that satisfy all constraints.
- **Optimization Solvers:** Algorithms that find the optimal solution by iteratively exploring the feasible region.
