##  Why uncertainty matters

Uncertainty is not a flaw, but a feature of data. It reflects the complexity and variability of the real world, and the limitations of our methods and tools. Ignoring or hiding uncertainty can lead to overconfidence, misinterpretation, or manipulation of data. On the other hand, acknowledging and communicating uncertainty can help you present a more accurate, nuanced, and transparent picture of your data, and invite your audience to engage with it critically and constructively. Uncertainty can also inspire curiosity, exploration, and learning, as you and your audience seek to understand the sources and effects of uncertainty, and how to reduce or account for it.

##   How to measure uncertainty

Before you can communicate uncertainty, it is necessary to measure it. There are various ways to quantify and express uncertainty in data, depending on the type and level of analysis being conducted. 

- Confidence intervals provide ranges of values that capture the true value of a parameter with a certain probability. 
- Standard errors measure the variability or precision of an estimate. 
- P-values are probabilities that assess the evidence against a null hypothesis. 
- Lastly, Bayesian statistics combine prior knowledge with new data to update the probability of a hypothesis or a parameter.
