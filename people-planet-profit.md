The "People, Planet, Profit" concept, also known as the triple bottom line (TBL), is an accounting framework that aims to evaluate the performance of an organization from three perspectives: social, environmental, and economic. 

- The "People" aspect refers to fair and beneficial business practices toward labor and the community, including reciprocal social structures and promoting the well-being of all stakeholders. 
- The "Planet" component focuses on sustainable environmental practices, aiming to benefit the natural order and reduce ecological footprint. 
- The "Profit" element deals with the economic value created by the organization after deducting all inputs' costs, emphasizing the real economic benefit enjoyed by the society.

The TBL framework encourages organizations to take a longer-term perspective, evaluating the future consequences of their decisions and overall impact on society and the environment.

TBL emphasises a broader evaluation of an organization's performance by considering social, environmental, and economic impacts. This approach encourages businesses to adopt sustainable and responsible practices, contributing to the well-being of society and the environment while maintaining economic value. By incorporating TBL principles, organizations can enhance their long-term resilience, reputation, and relationships with stakeholders. However, the TBL framework also presents challenges, including the complexity of measuring and quantifying social and environmental impacts. Additionally, some critics argue that the TBL may be used as a greenwashing tactic by organizations to divert attention from their actual environmental and social practices. Moreover, the practical application of TBL principles can be difficult, and there may be resistance to embracing the framework due to its potential impact on short-term financial performance.
