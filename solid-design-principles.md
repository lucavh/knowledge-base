SOLID is a set of five fundamental software design principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open/Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- [[dependency-inversion]]

Together, these principles aim to create maintainable, extensible, and robust object-oriented systems by promoting modularity, flexibility, and reduced code coupling.
