Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

### Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: Algorithms learn from a dataset called training data, which consists of input features and corresponding target outcomes.
- **Learning Process**: Machine learning algorithms identify patterns, relationships, and trends in training data to create predictive models or make decisions.
- **[[generalization]]**: Trained models apply learned patterns to new, unseen data, making predictions or decisions based on this generalization.

### Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: Involves training algorithms on labeled data, where inputs are paired with correct outputs. Common tasks include regression (predicting a continuous value) and classification (assigning labels to categories).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from unlabeled data, discovering patterns and structures within the data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are examples.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combines labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning efficiency and model accuracy.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Involves training agents to interact with an environment and learn optimal strategies through rewards and penalties.
