Financial independence occurs when your passive income (from investments, savings, or other non-labor sources) consistently covers your living expenses without requiring active work. This means you no longer depend on a paycheck to sustain your lifestyle.  

## Measuring Financial Independence  

A common rule of thumb is the **4% Rule**, which suggests that if you withdraw 4% annually from your investments, your portfolio should last at least 30 years. Based on this, a typical formula for financial independence is:  

`FI Number = Annual Expenses × 25`

For example, if you need **€30,000** per year to live, you would need around **€750,000** invested to be financially independent (assuming a 4% withdrawal rate).  

## Types of Financial Independence

- **Lean FI** – Covering only basic expenses with minimal lifestyle costs.  
- **Fat FI** – Accumulating more wealth to support a more comfortable or luxurious lifestyle.  

Other factors, such as inflation, market fluctuations, and personal risk tolerance, can influence when someone truly feels financially independent.
