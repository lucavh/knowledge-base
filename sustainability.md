Sustainability refers to the practice of meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. It encompasses environmental, social, and economic dimensions, aiming for a balanced approach to long-term well-being.

A widely used framework for sustainability is the [[triple-bottom-line]] (TBL), also known as **People, Planet, Profit**.
