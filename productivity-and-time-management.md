Tips to improve time management:
- Include time for travelling, preparation and processing in scheduled meetings
- Schedule important tasks in your calander if they take longer than 30 minutes
- Use the [[eisenhower-matrix]] to group and prioritize tasks
- Non-creative work is best planned in blocks of 0.5-1 hour. Creative work is best planned in half days.
