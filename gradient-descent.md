In the realm of machine learning and optimization, Gradient Descent is a foundational algorithm used to minimize functions, particularly in the context of training models. It's like a guide in a hilly landscape, helping us find the lowest point (minimum) efficiently.

Gradient descent is the backbone of training many machine learning models. It's used in tasks ranging from linear regression to complex neural networks. Without this optimization algorithm, the training of models would be infeasible for many real-world applications.
## Understanding the Landscape

- Imagine a landscape represented by a mathematical function. The slope of this function at a given point is known as the **rate of change**. It's like measuring how steep the terrain is at a specific location.
- The **learning rate** is like the size of the steps you take while navigating this landscape. If it's too large, you might overshoot the lowest point. If it's too small, progress could be excruciatingly slow. Finding the right balance is an art in itself. Typically, in practice, large steps are taken initially, and they become smaller as you get closer to the optimal point.
- An **epoch** is a single iteration or step in the gradient descent process. It represents one pass through the entire dataset.
## Variants of Gradient Descent

### Online or Stochastic Gradient Descent

In this variant, rather than using the entire dataset at once, the algorithm reads and processes one observation at a time. At each step, it updates the coefficients based on this single data point. It's like making small course corrections in real-time.
### Mini Batch Gradient Descent

Here, instead of considering just one observation or the entire dataset, we use a small batch (subset) of the data. The coefficients are updated based on this subset at each step. It's like making slightly larger course corrections, but not as large as considering the entire dataset at once.
