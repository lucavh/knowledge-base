## Types of notes

### Fleeting Notes

- Place them in `/inbox`.
- A fleeting note is a note you capture on the fly. 
- It can be an idea, a thought, or a valuable quote. You want to **capture ideas quickly** as soon as they arise so that you make sure to not lose them.

### Permanent Notes

- Convert Fleeting Notes into Permanent Notes
- A permanent note can be seen as a permanent resident of your Zettelkasten.
- You create a new note in Obsidian with the content of your fleeting note. However, to create a great permanent note, **the goal is to rewrite everything in your own words** (also called the Feynman technique.)

### Literature Notes

- Make every idea you take from a book into a stand-alone note (i.e: permanent note).
- Phases:
	- Reading phase: highlight interesting ideas and isolate the ideas that matter in physical book or on Kobo
	- Transfer phase: transfer highlights into Obsidian, each highlight becomes one note
	- Process phase: isolate ideas and connect them to what you already have in your system. 1 note = 1 idea

Keep in mind:
- The goal is to not have orphan notes (i.e: notes without links).
- Start with a FLAT structure. Ditch folders.
- Never repeat anything: everything should be in one place and one place only.
