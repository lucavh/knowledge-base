Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are a powerful group of [[tree-based-learning]] models widely used in machine learning for both [[regression]] and [[classification]] tasks. 

Also known as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) or Gradient Boosting Regression Trees, GBMs are an ensemble technique that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners, usually decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. By iteratively adding trees to correct the errors of the previous ones, GBMs can effectively improve model performance.
