Bayesian inference is a statistical method used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. It relies on Bayes' Theorem, which relates current evidence to prior belief. The key components include:

1. **Prior Probability**: The initial degree of belief in a hypothesis before seeing the new data.
2. **Likelihood**: The probability of the observed data under different hypotheses.
3. **Posterior Probability**: The updated probability of the hypothesis after considering the new data.

Bayesian inference is particularly useful for:

- **Updating Beliefs**: Continuously refining probability estimates as new data is received.
- **Decision Making**: Informing decisions in light of uncertain information.
- **Complex Models**: Handling models where traditional frequentist approaches may be difficult to apply.

The approach is widely used in various fields such as machine learning, medical diagnosis, and finance due to its ability to handle uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge into the analysis.
