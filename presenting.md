## Slide decks
- Titles should be enough for a summary of the presentation
- Slides should be self explanatory

## Asking questions
- What is the number one thing you learned?
- What is your number one take away? 
- What is it that you couldn’t do before and can do now?
- Looking forward, what is your next step?
- Looking back, what would you've done differently?
