Clustering algorithms are unsupervised machine learning techniques used to group similar data points together in a dataset. These algorithms aim to identify patterns and similarities within the data, allowing data points within the same cluster to be more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Clustering is widely used in various fields, such as data analysis, pattern recognition, image segmentation, and customer segmentation in marketing.

### Families of clustering algorithms

1. **Partition-based Clustering**: Algorithms in this family partition the data into distinct clusters, where each data point belongs to only one cluster. Examples include [[k-means]], K-Medoids algorithms and [[gaussian-mixture-models]].
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: These algorithms create a hierarchy of clusters, often represented as a dendrogram. Hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). An example of a hierarchical clustering algorithm is the [[hbdscan]]. HDBSCAN is a hierarchical, density-based clustering algorithm. There are, however, also pure hierarchical clustering algorithms.
	- __Agglomerative__: a bottom-up approach where each observation starts in its own cluster and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarch.
	- __Divisive__: a top-down approach where all observations start in one cluster and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.
1. **Density-based Clustering**: Density-based algorithms identify regions of high data point density as clusters. They can handle clusters of different shapes and can find outliers effectively. [[dbscan]] is a popular density-based clustering algorithm.
2. **Model-based Clustering**: Model-based algorithms assume that data points are generated from specific [[probability]] distributions. They aim to find the best-fitting model for each cluster. Examples include Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
3. **Fuzzy Clustering**: Fuzzy clustering allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with different degrees of membership. Fuzzy C-Means is a well-known fuzzy clustering algorithm.

### Use Cases

- **Customer Segmentation**: Clustering can help businesses group customers based on their purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing strategies.
- **Image Segmentation**: Clustering can be used to separate objects or regions of interest in images for various computer vision tasks.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Clustering can identify unusual patterns in data, helping detect outliers or anomalies in a dataset.
- **Document Clustering**: Grouping similar documents together can assist in information retrieval and document organization.
- **Social Network Analysis**: Clustering can be applied to identify communities or groups within social networks.

Clustering algorithms offer powerful tools for understanding the underlying structures in data, facilitating decision-making processes and gaining insights in various domains.
