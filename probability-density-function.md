The [[probability]] density function (PDF) is a fundamental concept in [[probability]] theory and [[statistics]]. It describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a particular value within a given range. The PDF is a non-negative function, and the area under its curve over a specific interval corresponds to the [[probability]] that the random variable falls within that interval.
