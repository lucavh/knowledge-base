The information expert principle is a [[software-design]] principle that suggests assigning responsibilities to the class with the most relevant information or knowledge. For example, in a shopping cart application, the Item class should handle price calculations as it possesses the necessary product information, leading to a cleaner and maintainable design.

The information expert principle belongs to the set of [[grasp-design-patterns]].
