-   How to determine portfolio allocation (stocks vs. fixed income):
    -   Your age in percentage of fixed income, for example, 25 years = 25% fixed income.
    -   During the accumulation phase, allocate 20% or less to fixed income and gradually increase to 30%.
    -   Bonds should act as shock absorbers, so it is wise to have enough to cover 5 years of living expenses to bridge bad market years.

-   Portfolio maintenance: rebalance the allocation between stocks & bonds once a year.
-   When choosing ETFs, pay attention to costs and currency.
-   In addition to the portfolio, have a buffer of 3 months of expenses.
