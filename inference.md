==Statistical inference== cannot prove anything with certainty, it can observe some pattern or outcome and then use probability to determine the most likely explanation for that outcome.
## Hypothesis testing

Define ==null hypothesis==, e.g. there is no difference, and define ==alternative hypothesis==, e.g. there is a difference. 
- Alternative hypothesis is a conlcusion that must be true if the null hypothesis can be rejected.
- You are aiming to reject the null hypothesis: "success"
- If you can't reject the null hypothesis, you typically say that you "failed to reject it".

==Significance level==: the upper bound for the likelihood of observing some pattern of data if the null hypothesis were true.

==P-value==: the specific probability of getting a result at least as extreme as the one you've observed if the null hypothesis were true or likelihood of observed difference in means.

==Confidence interval==: with 95% confidence the value is between two standard errors of the found value.

Rule of thumb: the threshold for rejecting null hypothesis is 5% (the significance level). Alternatively, it could be 1% or 10%.

==Type I== vs ==Type II== errors
- I: wrognly rejecting a true null hypothesis (false positive)
- II: failing to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative)
