**Week 1: Foundations of Bayesian Statistics**

- Read Chapters 1 and 2 of "Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers" to get a conceptual understanding of Bayesian thinking and probabilistic programming.
- Watch the first two weeks' video lectures of "Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis" to reinforce the concepts and gain insights from the instructors.

**Week 2-3: PyMC3 and Bayesian Inference**

- Start with Chapters 3 and 4 of "Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers" to learn about PyMC3, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Bayesian inference.
- Work through examples provided in PyMC3 documentation to get hands-on experience with Bayesian modeling and inference.
- Complete Week 3's video lectures of "Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis" to deepen your understanding of Bayesian inference.

**Week 4-5: Bayesian Models and Machine Learning**

- Read Chapters 5, 6, and 7 of "Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers" to explore various types of Bayesian models.
- Dive into the "Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning" course on Coursera and complete Weeks 1 to 4 to understand Bayesian linear regression, classification, and clustering using PyMC3.

**Week 6: Bayesian Data Analysis Book**

- Begin reading the "Bayesian Data Analysis" book. Start with Part I to get a comprehensive understanding of Bayesian concepts and their application.

**Week 7-8: Advanced Topics and Practice**

- Finish reading the "Bayesian Data Analysis" book. Pay attention to topics that align with your interests and applications.
- Explore advanced topics in Bayesian Statistics, such as Bayesian networks, hierarchical modeling, and Bayesian model comparison.
- Work on small projects using real-world datasets to apply Bayesian methods with PyMC3 and ArviZ.
- Continue reading blog articles on "Towards Data Science" for practical examples and case studies.

Throughout the learning process, make sure to supplement your studies with hands-on coding exercises and projects. Practice is crucial for developing a strong grasp of Bayesian Statistics using Python. Additionally, participate in online forums or communities where you can discuss concepts, ask questions, and get feedback from others in the field.

Remember that learning Bayesian Statistics can be a gradual process, and it's okay to revisit certain concepts if needed. Be patient and persistent in your learning journey. Enjoy your exploration of Bayesian Statistics, and best of luck with your studies!
