==Descriptive statistics== organise complex information into a single number. 
- Pro: Gives a meaningful summary of an underlying phenomenon. 
- Con: Can be misleading due to oversimplification.

==Absolute numbers== can usually be interpreted without any context, e.g. _3 goals_.
==Relative numbers== have meaning only in comparison to something else, e.g. _10th percentile_.

==Standard deviation== (σ) is a measure of how dispersed the data are from their mean.
==Variance== (σ^2) is similar and puts more emphasis on the outliers.

Knowing the mean and standard deviation provides much insight into the data!

==Percentage change== (relative change) ≠ ==change in percentage points== (absolute change)
Percentage change = `(new - old) / old`
