HDBSCAN is a hierarchical, density-based [[clustering-algorithms]]. It is an extension of [[dbscan]] and an appropriate choice for more randomly distributed data. HDBSCAN is performed over varying epsilon values and the result is integrated, which allows HDBSCAN to find clusters of varying densities - unlike [[dbscan]].
