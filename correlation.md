==Correlation== is the degree to which two phenomena are related to one another. 

The correlation coefficient is a number ranging from -1 to 1:
- 1 or -1: every change in one variable is associalted with an equivalent change in the other variable in the same direction (1) or the opposite (-1)
- 0: variables have no meaningful association with one another

Correlation does not imply causation!
