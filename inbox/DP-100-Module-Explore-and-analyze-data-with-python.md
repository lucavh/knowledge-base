# Explore and analyze data with Python

## Exploring and visualizing data

The loc method returned rows with index label in the list of values from 0 to 5 - which includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (six rows). However, the iloc method returns the rows in the positions included in the range 0 to 5, and since integer ranges don't include the upper-bound value, this includes positions 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 (five rows).

```df_students[df_students['Name']=='Aisha'] == df_students.query('Name=="Aisha"')```

Probability density function: estimates the distribution of values for the full population based on a sample.

## Working with real world data

With real-world data, make sure to: 
- Check for missing values and badly recorded data
- Consider removal of obvious outliers
- Consider what real-world factors might affect your analysis and consider if your dataset size is large enough to handle this
- Check for biased raw data and consider your options to fix this, if found
