- **Date and time features** Creating features from the dates available, e.g. is a holidays or day of the week.
- **Group values** Grouping various numeric elements to a categorical variable, e.g. the months December (12), January (1) and February (2) to the season Winter.
- **Grouping sparse classes** If you have a feature with an individual low sample count, you might group various values together under some other category. For example: if we had a column `bike_type` it would make sense to have stand-alone values such as `race`, `road` or `grandma`, whereas you might want to group values lik `penny farthing`, `unicycle` and `tricycle` together under a single `other` category since they are rarely rented.
- **Group from threshold** A new grouped variable for other variables, e.g. `warm` and `cold` based on the temperature.
- **Indicator from threshold** An indicator variable (0 or 1) based on a threshold on a column, e.g. eligible to vote/work based on age.
- **Interaction of variables** The sum, difference, product or quotient of two features. E.g. `profit` as result of the difference between income and expenses.
