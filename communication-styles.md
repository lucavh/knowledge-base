There are several communication style frameworks designed to help people better understand individuals’ communication preferences.

Regardless of the framework used, it’s important to understand that communication styles are not fixed and can (and should) vary depending on the situation and individual preferences. For example, an assertive communication style may be appropriate in a high-stakes negotiation, while a passive communication style may be more appropriate in a situation where relationship-building is a priority.

The key to effective collaboration is adaptability and empathy. This means being able to recognize and respond to different communication styles in a way that promotes understanding and collaboration.
