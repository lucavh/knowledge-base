The ==Bayes Network== is a compact representation of a distribution over a very large joint probability distribution of all of the variables.

Once you **specify** the Bayes Network, you can **observe** variables and then compute **probabilities**.

Bayes networks are the building blocks or more advanced AI techniques, such as Particle Filters, Hidden Markov Models, MDP's, POMDP's and Kalman Filters.
