The ==Bayes Network== is a compact representation of a distribution over a very large joint probability distribution of all of the variables.

They are particularly useful because they provide a compact representation for practically arbitrary distributions, and efficient algorithms exist to sample and perform inference over the joint distribution.

Once you **specify** the Bayes Network, you can **observe** variables and then compute **probabilities**.

Bayes networks are the building blocks or more advanced AI techniques, such as Particle Filters, Hidden Markov Models, MDP's, POMDP's and Kalman Filters.
