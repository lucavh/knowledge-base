On traineeships:
- Building your engineering skills is never a waste, and that is the emphasis of this program primarily. It is very effective and fun in developing engineers as such. Its mostly a matter of this is what you want to develop in this point in time as well. You’ll typically land within an motivated and diverse group of international engineers that share a lot both at work and outside of it. And with a bit of side project and a dash of luck, you might end up in DS still.

Focus on learning:
- When still young, try and find places where you’ll learn and develop fast. It’s not about finding the perfect match, as you’ll simply continue to grow and develop over the years and decades to come, and as long as what you learn is relevant (enough) the rate of learning is what matters most.
