- 3 doors, 1 prize, 2 goats
- Choose one door, e.g. door B
- One of the other doors is opened, always revealing a goat, e.g. door C
- Do you want to change to door A? **Yes**, you should always change, because: 
	- If you stick with your choice, you have ⅓ change of winning.
	- If you change, you technically choose two doors, and from those two you will always get the correct oor, this increase the change of winning to ⅔.
