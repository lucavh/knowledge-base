Brugman, R. (2019). De meeste mensen deugen. De Correspondent.

The book challenges common assumptions about human nature:

1. **Innate Goodness**: Bregman argues that humans are fundamentally good-natured, compassionate, and cooperative. He presents historical and psychological evidence to support this view.
2. **Crisis Experiments**: The author discusses various instances, like the Blitz in London and natural disasters, where people demonstrated remarkable altruism and solidarity during times of crisis.
3. **Institutional Influence**: Bregman suggests that societal structures and systems heavily influence behavior. He emphasizes the importance of creating environments that encourage cooperation and trust.
4. **Reframing Narratives**: The book encourages a shift in how we perceive human behavior. Rather than assuming the worst, Bregman advocates for a more positive outlook, believing it can lead to a more harmonious society.
    
5. **Historical Examples**: Bregman provides examples from history, such as the real-life events of the stranded boys in Lord of the Flies, to challenge the conventional notion that humans are inherently selfish and violent.
6. **Utopian Vision**: The book concludes with a vision of a more compassionate, equitable, and cooperative society, urging readers to strive for positive change.

Brugman mentions several life rules that provide a framework for approaching life with positivity, understanding, and compassion:

1. Assume the best in others when in doubt.
2. Aim for win-win situations; goodness feels good.
3. Treat others how they want to be treated, not necessarily how you want to be treated. Empathize and ask questions.
4. Balance empathy with compassion. Empathy can be draining, while compassion provides support without fully immersing in another's pain.
5. Seek to understand others even when you don't fully comprehend their perspective.
6. Prioritize love for those closest to you; a stable foundation enables broader positive impact.
7. Limit exposure to news, as it often focuses on exceptions and negative instances.
8. Extend a hand to your greatest adversary.
9. Embrace and proudly display acts of kindness.
10. Be realistic, not cynical. Place trust in others, act with kindness, and be loving.

"De meeste mensen deugen" is a call to reevaluate our assumptions about human nature and consider the potential for collective goodness and collaboration. Bregman's work has sparked important discussions about the nature of humanity and how we can shape a more harmonious future.
