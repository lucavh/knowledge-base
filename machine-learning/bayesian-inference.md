# 1. The Philosophy of Bayesian Inference
## The Bayesian state of mind
- Bayesians interpret a probability as measure of belief, or confidence, of an event occurring.
- Notation:
    - `P(A)`: prior probability of event A: 
    - `P(A|X)`: posterior probability of event A (probability of A given the evidence X)
- Example: 
    - `P(A)`: The patient could have any number of diseases. 
    - `P(A|X)`: Performing a blood test generated evidence X, ruling out some of the possible diseases from consideration.
