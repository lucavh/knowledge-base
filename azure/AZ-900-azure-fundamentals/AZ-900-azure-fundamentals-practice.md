## Concepts
---
### Cloud advantages
- Paying only for the capacity when needed, is an example of elasticity.
- A financial analysis of migration of on-premises files to Azure Storage showed that storing data in Azure would be less expensive than hosting it on-premises. The report also showed unit cost in Azure would decrease even further as the data archive grows. This is an example of economies of scale.
---
### Cloud models & expenditures
- Example of Private Cloud: hosting business applications in a shared virtualisation infrastructure on-premises, utilising Hyper-V.
- ⚠️ Hybrid Cloud is recommended when you need aditional capacity on-prem, minimise capital expense (CapEx) and minimise operational expense (OpEx). 
- Operational expense: Azure SQL Database
- Capital expense: On-premise SQL cluster
- Migrating existing on-premises SQL VMs to Azure, implements the Operational Expenditure model.
---
### SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
- Examples of SaaS: Office 365
- Examples of PaaS: Event Grid, Azure App Service, Azure (My)SQL Database, Cosmos DB
- Examples of IaaS: Azure VMs
- With SaaS you are responsible for configuring the solution features. Not for maintaining infra, not for deploying updates, not for availability and scalability. 
---
### Azure Region
- Datacenters in Azure Region are connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. 
- Azure China 
	- ⚠️ Available to legal entities in China. Not any organisation globally, doing business in China. 
	- Workloads deployed on Azure China can be accessed anywhere globally.
- Azure Germany
	- ⚠️ Available to eligible customers and partners globally doing business in the EU/EFTA. Not to anyone who wants data residency in Germany.
### Azure Availability Sets
- ⚠️ Protect against server rack-level failures.
### Azure Availability Zones
- ⚠️ Protect against datacenter-level failures. 
- By utilising availability zones, the service will remain available if a single Azure datacenter fails.
---
### Service Previews
- Standard lifecycle for Azure services released by Microsoft: Private Preview -> Public Preview -> General Availability.
- Azure services in Public Preview are available to all costumers, are NOT available in all Azure regions and do NOT include an SLA.
---
### SLA's
- Guarantees about uptime and connectivity, varies by service.
- All free Azure services have a minimum SLA of 99.9% (three 9's).
---
### Resources
- Use resource locks (read-only) to prevent resources from being created/deleted (including administrators).
### Resource Groups
- There are no additional costs when using additional resource groups.
- Resources do not inherit the taks assigned to the parent resource group.
- A resource group can have resources deployed in multiple regions. 
### Security Groups
- ⚠️ Group users for assignment of permissions (Office 365). Less suitable: Resource Groups.
### Management Groups
- ⚠️ Apply standards across deployments in multiple Azure subscriptions.
### Subscriptions
- Multiple subscriptions can be associated to the same Azure AD.
- ⚠️ Open a support request when you've reached the limits in your Azure subscription.
---
### Azure Tags
- ⚠️ Simplify cost reporting per business unit. 
---
### Accounts & identity management
- Use Azure Free account to try some Azure services (max. 12 months).
- Authentication: user authentication is the process of validating that a user is who they claim to be.
- Authorization: RBAC is an example of authorization.
- ⚠️ For SSO, Password Hash Synchronisation and Pass-through authentication are available. You cannot support SSO and multi-factor authentication without synchronising on-premises identities to Azure.
- RBAC are inherited: management groups > subscriptions > resource groups > resources.

### Pricing / Cost Management
#### Azure Price Calculator vs Azure TCO Calculator
- The Azure Calculator is meant to get pricing when you know exactly what you need in Azure, or want to look up pricing for the resources you know about. TCO Calculator is meant when you want to estimate how much it would cost to move your resources from on-premises to Azure, by inputting what you are currently using, and letting it convert that into Azure equivalence.
#### Azure Reservations
- Pricing option (commitment of X years) to reduce hosting costs if planning to run services for an extended period (years) and make predicting future spending easier.
#### Azure Cost Management
- Analyze past cloud usage and expenses, and predict future expenses.
- Do not use for:
	- Identify recommendations on how to reduce the cost of running VMs (Azure Advisor)
---
### Best practices & Recommendations
#### Azure Advisor
- ⚠️ Identify recommendations on how to reduce the cost of running VMs.
- Get best practice recommendations for high availability of your existing VM resources. 
- Do not use for:
	- Identifing deviations from Microsoft security best practices in your Azure cloud infrastructure (Azure Security Center).
#### The Trust Center
- ⚠️ Verify that Azure complies with regulatory obligations. 
---
### Compute
#### Azure Container Instances
- Enable elastic bursting for Azure Kubernetes Service.
- ⚠️ Do NOT provide feature parity for Linux and Windows containers.
- ⚠️ Do NOT enable running containers without servers to manage.
#### Azure VMs
- Azure doesn't charge for the VM core hours while it is Stopped (Deallocated). However, you continue to accrue charges for the Azure storage needed for the VM’s OS disk and any attached data disks. 
### Serverless computing
#### Azure Functions
- Execute code: automate a task using a script with minimum cost and maintenance effort.
#### Azure Logic Apps
- Execute (business) workflows based on triggers: automate business processes in a low-code environment with a visual interface.
---
### Security
#### Azure Security Center & Azure Sentinel

#### Azure Security Center
- ⚠️ Identify deviations from Microsoft security best practices in your Azure cloud infrastructure.
- Verify whether your Azure environment meets regulatory requirements.
- Find recommendations for security best practices and security configuration for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
#### Azure Key Vault
- Store, manage and access SSL/TLS certificates.
#### Defender for Cloud Apps
- Use Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly Microsoft Cloud App Security) to discover Shadow IT (non-sanctioned apps).
#### Defender for Identity
- Use Microsoft Defender for Identity (formerly Azure Advanced Threat Protection - ATP) to protect on-premises identities from external threats.
#### Azure DDoS
- Azure DDoS, which protects your Azure resources against distributed denial of services attacks, includes both Basic and Standard tiers.
#### Azure Information Protection (AIP)
- Cloud-based solution that enables organisations to discover, classify, and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content.
#### Azure AD Identity Protection
- Protect your Azure identities from external threats. 
- ⚠️ Set up risk-based policies in Azure AD, such as logging in from anonymous IP or unusual location. Less suitable: Azure AD Conditional Access.

### Networking
#### Connecting on-premise <=> Azure
1. Point-to-site connectivity with Virtual Network
	- Manually connect
2. Site-to-site connectivity with Virtual Network 
	- Keep communication up all the time
	- The Azure Virtual Network Gateway is the cross-premises gateway that connects your Azure Virtual Network with your on-premises VPN appliances.

---
### Policies
#### Azure Policy
- Azure Policy is a service in Azure which allows you create polices which enforce and control the properties of a resource. When these policies are used they enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your IT governance standards.
- Identify and enforce standards across new and existing Azure deployments.
- Make sure that resources are only created in approved regions. 
#### Azure Access Policies
- Apply authorization standards across deployments in multiple Azure subscriptions. 
#### Azure Initiatives
