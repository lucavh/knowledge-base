# AZ-900 - Practice

## Concepts
---
### Azure Portal
- Use https://portal.azure.com to access the Azure Portal.
- Use Azure Marketplace to find an offering to quickly deploy a WordPress website.
---
### Cloud advantages
- Paying only for the capacity when needed, is an example of elasticity.
- A financial analysis of migration of on-premises files to Azure Storage showed that storing data in Azure would be less expensive than hosting it on-premises. The report also showed unit cost in Azure would decrease even further as the data archive grows. This is an example of economies of scale.
---
### Cloud models & expenditures
- Company X is planning to move to Azure, but currently hosts business applications in a shared virtualisation infrastructure on-premises, utilising Hyper-V. This is an example of Private Cloud.
- ⚠️ You need to provide additional capacity than what is currently available on-prem. The solution must minimise capital expense (CapEx) and operational expense (OpEx). Then, a hybrid cloud is recommended.
- Azure SQL Database and an on-premise SQL cluster represent an Operational expense and a Capital expense, respectively.
- Migrating existing on-premises SQL VMs to Azure, implements the Operational Expenditure model.
---
### SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
- Office 365, Azure VMs and Event Grid represent, SaaS, IaaS and Paas, respectively.
- With Software as a Service you are responsible for configuring the solution features. Not for maintaining infra, not for deploying updates, not for availability and scalability. 
- Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Cosmos DB are examples of Platform as a Service. 
Hosting databases for customer-facing web applications in Azure MySQL Database is an example of platform as a service.
- Azure VMs are Infrastructure as a Service.
---
### Azure Datacenters
- Azure availability zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures. By utilising availability zones, the service will remain available if a single Azure datacenter fails.
- Each Azure Region features datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter. They're connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network. 
- ⚠️ An Azure Availability Sets protects against server rack-level failures. 
- Azure China 
	- An Azure Availability Zone protects against datacenter-level failures.
	- ⚠️ Azure China is available to legal entities in China. Not any organisation globally, doing business in China. 
	- Can workloads deployed on Azure China be accessed anywhere globally? Yes, you can access your workloads deployed on Azure China anywhere globally.
- Azure Germany
	- ⚠️ Azure Germany is available to eligible customers and partners globally doing business in the EU/EFTA. Not to anyone who wants data residency in Germany.
- Use Azure Site Recovery for service recovery in the event of site outage at on-premises datacenter. 
---
### Service Previews
- Standard lifecycle for Azure services released by Microsoft:
	1. Private Preview
	2. Public Preview
	3. General Availability
- Azure services in Public Preview 
	- are available to all costumers.
	- are NOT available in all Azure regions.
	- do NOT include an SLA
---
### SLA's
- Guarantees about uptime and connectivity, varies by service.
- All free Azure services have a minimum SLA of 99.9% (three 9's).
---
### Resources
- Use resource locks (read-only) to prevent additional resources from being created/deleted in an Azure resource group (including administrators).
### Resource Groups
- There are no additional costs when using additional resource groups.
- Resources do not inherit the taks assigned to the parent resource group.
- A resource group can have resources deployed in multiple regions. 
### Security Groups
- ⚠️ Group users for assignment of permissions (Office 365). Less suitable: Resource Groups.
### Management Groups
- ⚠️ Apply standards across deployments in multiple Azure subscriptions.
### Subscriptions
- Multiple subscriptions can be associated to the same Azure AD.
- ⚠️ Open a support request when you've reached the limits in your Azure subscription.
---
### Azure Tags
- ⚠️ Simplify cost reporting per business unit. 
---
### Accounts & identity management
- Use Azure Free account to try some Azure services (max. 12 months).
- Authentication: user authentication is the process of validating that a user is who they claim to be.
- Authorization: RBAC is an example of authorization.
- ⚠️ For SSO, Password Hash Synchronisation and Pass-through authentication are available. You cannot support SSO and multi-factor authentication without synchronising on-premises identities to Azure.
- RBAC are inherited: management groups > subscriptions > resource groups > resources.

## Tools
---
### Compliance & Regulations
#### Microsoft Trust Center
- Determine if the Azure platform meets particular regulatory standard.
---
### Pricing / Cost Management
#### Azure Price Calculator vs Azure TCO Calculator
- The Azure Calculator is meant to get pricing when you know exactly what you need in Azure, or want to look up pricing for the resources you know about. TCO Calculator is meant when you want to estimate how much it would cost to move your resources from on-premises to Azure, by inputting what you are currently using, and letting it convert that into Azure equivalence.
#### Azure Pricing Calculator
- Prior to migration, costs can be estimated using the Azure Pricing Calculator.
- Calculate estimated cost before deploying. 
#### Azure Reservations
- Pricing option (commitment of X years) to reduce hosting costs if planning to run services for an extended period (years) and make predicting future spending easier.
#### Azure Cost Management
- Analyze past cloud usage and expenses, and predict future expenses.

### Networking
#### Connecting on-premise <=> Azure
1. Point-to-site connectivity with Virtual Network (manually connect)
2. Site-to-site connectivity with Virtual Network (keep communication up all the time) 
3. Private site-to-site connectivity with ExpressRoute (private connections)
- In a Site-to-Site VPN, the Azure Virtual Network Gateway is the cross-premises gateway that connects your Azure Virtual Network with your on-premises VPN appliances. 
- ⚠️ Use Site-to-Site VPN to connect on-premises datacenter to Azure with minimal expense during low-scale pilot deployment.
- Use Azure ExpressRoute to connect on-premises application resources, minimise latency and maximise security. 
#### Azure Firewall
- Deploy an Azure Firewall to securely limit inbound traffic and protect VMs from unwanted inbound requests. 
#### Virtual Networks

- ⚠️ Azure routes traffic between all subnets within a virtual network, by default. Create a user defined route to override Azure's default routing. 
- Azure VMs in different virtual networks can not communicate by default.
#### Azure Traffic Manager vs Azure Load Balancer
- Azure Traffic Manager is been designed to distribute traffic globally (multiregional environments). 
- Azure Load Balancer can only route traffic inside an Azure region, as it only works with Virtual Machines in the same region.
#### Azure Traffic Manager
- Non-HTTP(s) load balancing option with minimal latency globally. 
#### Application Security Group (ASG)
- ⚠️ Restrict communication for current and future resources with a minimum of administrative effort.
#### Network Security Group (NSG)

---
### Policies
#### Azure Policiy vs Azure Initiative
- Azure Policy is a service in Azure which allows you create polices which enforce and control the properties of a resource. When these policies are used they enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your IT governance standards.
- An Azure initiative is a collection of Azure policy definitions that are grouped together towards a specific goal or purpose in mind. Azure initiatives simplify management of your policies by grouping a set of policies together as one single item.
#### Azure Policy
-  Identify and enforce standards across new and existing Azure deployments.
- Make sure that resources are only created in approved regions.
