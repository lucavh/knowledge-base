By using type hints, programmers can improve code readability and catch potential errors early during development. While type hints are not enforced at runtime by the [[Python]] interpreter, they can be checked using tools like `mypy` to ensure type consistency.

```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
return a + b  

add_numbers(5, 10)  
>>> 15
```

In this example, we use type hints to specify that the function `add_numbers` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, both of type `int`, and returns an `int`. This clarifies the expected types of inputs and the return value, making it easier for other developers to understand and use the function correctly.

## Optional type hints

```python
def addPilot(name: Optional[str] = None):
```

## Precise type hinting with Enums

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import enum

class OrgRole(Enum):
    CEO = "ceo"
    PRESIDENT = "president"
    STAFF = "staff"

@dataclass Employee:
    name:str
    role: OrgRole
```
