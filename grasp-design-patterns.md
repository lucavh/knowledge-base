GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns) is a collection of software design principles and patterns that guide developers in assigning responsibilities to classes and objects effectively. These principles include:

- [[creator-principle-design-pattern]]
- [[information-expert-principle-design-pattern]]
- [[controller-design-pattern]]
- [[protected-variations-design-pattern]]
- [[indirection-design-pattern]]
- [[low-coupling-and-high-cohesion]]
- [[polymorphism-design-pattern]]
- [[pure-fabrication-design-pattern]]

Applying GRASP helps in achieving a more maintainable, adaptable, and scalable design in object-oriented systems.
