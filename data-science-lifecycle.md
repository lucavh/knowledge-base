The data science lifecycle is a series of iterative steps to create, deploy and monitor an analytical model. Framing data science projects within the four steps of the DSLC makes it much easier to manage limited resources and control timelines, while ensuring projects meet or exceed the business requirements they were designed for.

At its highest level, the DSLC consists of four phases: Manage, Develop, Deploy, and Monitor. Within each phase there are multiple iterative steps through which a project progresses to ultimately generate a production model. The project may loop back through prior steps to get more data, build new features, try a different algorithm, adjust hyperparameters, and so on. Even after deployment, when model performance decays a model will return to a prior step to be retrained or rebuilt.
