# Structure mentoring with the GROW model

Empowering dialogue for achieving higher level of clarity and taking action.
### 1. Goal - what do you really want?

Clarify the __goal__ or __outcome__ your partner wants to achieve.

- “What do you want to change?”
- “What really matters to you? Why is it important for you?”
- “How will you know that you have achieved that goal?”
### 2. Reality - where are you now?

Map the __current situation__ and find out __what works__ and what is __holding__ someone __back__.

- “What is your current situation? What has contributed to your success so far?"
- “What do you think is holding you back from achieving that goal?”
- “What have you learned from these experiences?”
### 3. Opportunities - what can you do?

Discover __options__, __strategies__ and __opportunities__ that are available for reaching that goal.

- "In which ways can you achieve that goal?”
- “If anything was possible, what would you do?”
- “How other people have solved it?” “Who could help you?”
- “What would be the effective way to do it?”
### 4. Will - what are you going to do?

Define __what__ needs to be done and by __when__. Is there enough passion and will?

- “What kind of action are you going to take? By what time will you do it?”
- “What kind of obstacles you may face? In which ways can you overcome those obstacles?”
- “You mentioned doing ________. What would commit you to do that?”
- “Which specific step will you take today or this week to move closer to your goal?”
### 5. Check the motivation level – will you do it?

- “On scale from 1 to 10, how committed are you to do it?”
- “What can you do to turn `six` into `eight`?”
- “In which ways can you make sure it will be done?”
