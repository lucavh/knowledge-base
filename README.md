# knowledge-base

This repository serves as a collection of notes and useful links I've gathered during my learning journey. 

Inspired by [this great YouTube video](https://youtu.be/L9SLlxaEEXY), I've started to experiment with the Zettelkasten Method and I'm structuring my knowledge base using this powerful note-taking approach.

The [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/), developed by Niklas Luhmann, involves creating individual notes (Zettels) for each concept or idea. Each note focuses on a single idea and is given a unique identifier. The method emphasises linking notes to build a network of interconnected knowledge, fostering associative thinking and inspiring new insights.

To facilitate this experiment, I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a feature-rich knowledge management and note-taking app. Obsidian supports the principles of the Zettelkasten Method and offers a digital platform to organise and link notes effectively. I'm using the [`obsidian-git`](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) plug-in to easily sync my repository with Obsidian.

As a note to myself: remember to keep notes focused, use meaningful titles, and establish regular review sessions to expand your knowledge graph.
