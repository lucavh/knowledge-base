1. Random Sampling
	- Discrete & continuous hyperparemters
	- Selects combination with best results
	- Supports early termination
2. Grid Sampling
	- Only discrete hyperparameters
	- Selects combination with best results
	- Supports early termination
3. Bayesian Sampling
	- Discrete & continuous hyperparemters
	- Selects combination by learning from the previous run
	- Uses Bayesian optimization for getting the best combination
	- Does not support early termination
