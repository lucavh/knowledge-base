The difference between a poll and other forms of sampling is that the interest is not in the mean, but rather the percentage or proportion.

==Standard error for proportion==: `âˆš(p(1-p)/n)`
- The standard error tends to be smaller when `p` and `(1-p)` are far apart
- When calculating with different proportions, usually the largest SE is used for all proportions. Or assuming `p = .5`, generating the largest SE for that sample.
