Pulp provides a convenient interface to modelling and solving [[linear-programming]] problems using various optimization solvers.

PuLP simplifies the process of formulating and solving LP problems in [[Python]]. It supports a variety of optimization solvers, including open-source solvers like CBC and commercial solvers like CPLEX and Gurobi.

**Example Code:**

Consider a simple LP problem where we want to maximize the objective function `3x + 2y`, subject to the constraints `2x + y <= 20`, `4x - 5y => -10`, `x => 0` and `y => 0`.

```python
from pulp import LpMaximize, LpProblem, LpVariable

# Create a linear programming problem
model = LpProblem(name="simple_lp_problem", sense=LpMaximize)

# Define decision variables
x = LpVariable(name="x", lowBound=0)
y = LpVariable(name="y", lowBound=0)

# Objective function
model += 3 * x + 2 * y, "Objective"

# Constraints
model += (2 * x + y <= 20, "constraint1")
model += (4 * x - 5 * y >= -10, "constraint2")

# Solve the problem
model.solve()

# Display the results
print("Optimal value for x:", x.value())
print("Optimal value for y:", y.value())
print("Optimal objective value:", model.objective.value())
```

In this example, PuLP is used to define decision variables, set up the objective function and constraints, and solve the linear programming problem. The results provide the optimal values for the decision variables (x and y) and the optimal objective value.
