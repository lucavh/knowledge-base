## Preparation

### Make presentation interactive 

- Let people guess numbers
- Ask about composition of target audience. Let people show hands based on a given statement, then ask one or two to share their answer.
### Content

- Tailor your content to your audience
- Mention facts and numbers to back story and to make it unexpected
- The objective of your presentation is where your aiming to go with your talk
	- Should be simple, direct and active.
	- Ask yourself why multiple times to get to the core of your objective, for example:

```
Initial objective: 
	I would like to inspire my students to go do some public speaking.

Why? 
	It is the best way to practive but often anxiety will prevent people from 
	doing it.

Why? 
	Because anyone suffers from some form of anxiety when doing public speaking.

Why? 
	When you do something you realise it is never as bad as what your anxiety 
	tells you.

Final objective: 
	I would like to help my students overcome their anxiety when looking for 
	opportunities to do public speaking.
```
