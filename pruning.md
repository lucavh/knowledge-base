Pruning is a technique used in [[machine-learning]] to enhance the performance and [[generalization]] of decision trees. It involves selectively removing certain branches and nodes from a [[tree-based-learning]] algorithm to reduce complexity and overfitting. Pruning ensures that the tree's structure remains concise while maintaining its predictive accuracy.

## Types of Pruning

- **Pre-Pruning**: Also called early stopping, pre-pruning involves stopping the tree construction process prematurely when certain conditions are met, such as limiting the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples in a leaf.
- **Post-Pruning (Cost-Complexity Pruning)**: After constructing the tree, post-pruning involves iteratively removing nodes and assessing their impact on validation data. The removal criteria are based on metrics like accuracy or impurity reduction.

### Benefits and Trade-offs

- **Benefits**: Pruning simplifies trees, leading to easier interpretation, reduced memory usage, and faster predictions. It enhances the tree's ability to generalize on new data.
- **Trade-offs**: Aggressive pruning might lead to underfitting, where the tree is too simple to capture complex relationships. Striking the right balance is crucial.
