Method chaining is a technique used to perform multiple data transformations in a single line of code. Method chaining in Pandas allows for cleaner, more readable code and helps streamline data processing workflows.

Example of method chaining (with classes):

```python
# story without method chaining
on_hill = went_up(jack_jill, 'hill')
with_water = fetch(on_hill, 'water')
fallen = fell_down(with_water, 'jack')
broken = broke(fallen, 'jack')
after = tmple_after(broken, 'jill')

# story with method chaining
jack_jill = JackAndJill()
(
	jack_jill
	.went_up('hill')
    .fetch('water')
    .fell_down('jack')
    .broke('crown')
    .tumble_after('jill')
)
```
