1. No amount of fancy analysis can make up for fundamentally ==flawed data==: garbage in, garbage out.
2. Data should be representative of some larger group or population. Bigger is better (smoothing away errors), **but** a larger bad sample is worse than a bad small sample as it gives a false sense of confidence.
3. Data must have a source of comparison: ==control== vs. ==treatment group==. It can be very difficult to isolate the impact of one specific attribute, therefore, randomisation should be applied. Doing so, you assume that it will evenly divide all relevant characteristics between the two groups (both the things you can observe, as well as those you cannot measure).
