A time manamgement technique to improve productivity invented by Dwight D. Eisenhower. He was the 34th President of the United States from 1953 until 1961. 

Dwight had to make tough decisions continuously about which of the many tasks he should focus on each day. This finally led him to invent the world-famous Eisenhower principle, which today helps us prioritize by urgency and importance.

The Eisenhower matrix:

|  | urgent | not urgent |
| - | - | - |
| **important** | I - do first | II - schedule |
| **not important** | III - delegate | IV - don't do |

1. Need to be done today or tomorrow at latest. You could use a timer to help you concentrate while trying to get as much of them done as possible. 
2. Put these tasks in calendar. It generally works best to manage most of your work in this quadrant, reducing stress by terminating urgent and important to-dos to a reasonable date in the near future whenever a new task comes in.
3. The third quadrant is for those tasks you could _delegate_ as they are less important to you than others but still pretty urgent. You should keep track of delegated tasks by e-mail, telephone or within a meeting to check back on their progress later.
4. This quadrant is to help you sort out things you should not be doing at all. Helps to discover bad habits.
