## Low coupling

- Allows you to split up your code, having less dependencies and higher reuse potential.
- Coupling is a measure of how strongly one element is connected to, has knowledge of, or relies on other elements.Â 

## High cohesion

- Allows you to minimize responsibilities of classes or modules in your code in order to keep them manageable and easy to understand.
- Recommendation: make classes/modules either data focused (representing data structure) or behavior focues (keep data associated realtively simple)
