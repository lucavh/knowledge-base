## Finding the Right Words

### What Makes an Effective and Persuasive Talk?

- Simplicity
- Unexpected (e.g. mentioning huge numbers)
- Concrete (use concrete simple language to explain abstract ideas)
- Credibility (using data to back up what you're saying, but use it sparingly)
- Emotions (engaging emotions makes communication much more stickier)
- Stories 

### Nailing the Objective of Your Presentation

- Objective is where your aiming to go with your talk
- Should be simple (one sentence), direct and active
- Ask yourself why multiple times to get to the core of your objective, for example:

>Initial objective: 
>	I would like to inspire my students to go do some public speaking.
>
>Why? 
>	It is the best way to practive but often anxiety will prevent people from doing it.
>
>Why? 
>	Because anyone suffers from some form of anxiety when doing public speaking.
>
>Why? 
>	When you do something you realise it is never as bad as what your anxiety tells you.
>
>Final objective: 
>	I would like to help my students overcome their anxiety when looking for opportunities to do public speaking.

### Mapping Out and Tailoring Your Content to Your Audience

- Your audience is one of the most important things
