[Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML)](https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/products/machine-learning) is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft [[Azure]] designed to streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools and infrastructure for:

1. Data Preparation: Efficiently gather, clean, and transform data.
2. Experimentation: Build, train, and evaluate machine learning models using various algorithms and frameworks.
3. Model Management: Store, version, and query models, ensuring reproducibility and auditability.
4. Deployment: Deploy models to production in different environments (cloud or edge) using managed endpoints.
5. Monitoring: Track performance and detect data drift in deployed models to maintain accuracy over time.
6. Collaboration: Supports team collaboration, enabling data scientists, engineers, and business stakeholders to work together seamlessly.

Azure ML aims to make AI development accessible, scalable, and secure, leveraging the computational power of the cloud.
