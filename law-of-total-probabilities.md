The law of total probabilities expresses the total probability of an outcome by combining several distinct events. The ==total probability theorem== provides a method to find the probability of an event by considering all possible ways in which the event can occur. It can be expressed as: 

`P(A) = ∑_i P(A|B_i) * P(B_i)`

- A is the event whose probability we want to find,
- B_i​ are the mutually exclusive and exhaustive events that partition the sample space,
- P(A|B_i) is the conditional probability of A given B_i​, 
- P(Bi​) is the probability of event B_i​
- This formula states that the probability of event A is the sum of the probabilities of A occurring given each possible partition B_i​, each weighted by the probability of B_i​.
