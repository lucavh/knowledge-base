k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a simple and intuitive supervised [[machine-learning]] algorithm used for both [[classification]] and [[regression]] tasks.

Given a new, unseen data point, the algorithm finds the 'k' training examples (data points with known labels or values) that are closest to it in the feature space.

**Hyperparameter 'k':** The choice of 'k' is a hyperparameter that needs to be specified. It greatly influences the behavior of the model. A small 'k' may lead to noisy predictions, while a large 'k' may lead to overly smoothed predictions.
